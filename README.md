BuJoApp is an amazing system that keeps a record of everything you could ever want to toss at it.
It can be your task manager, sketchbook, journal, idea catcher, and much more! The BuJoApp is a
organizational system in your browser that keeps track of anything you would like to in an coherent way. Our app is designed to be simple. We belive that simplicity is a wey to to be focused and productove.

2) [lfiedoro](https://github.com/lfiedoro) - Webpack configuration, API request (using AXIOS), dockerizing, express server.
